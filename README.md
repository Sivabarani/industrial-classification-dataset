# industrial classification dataset

This dataset describe the industrial workers. it is 2011 dataset. this datset contain male and female workers, main and marginal workers(temporary workers).

In this dataset, we cannot determine which variable should be predicted, as there is no clear target variable.

**Understanding Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning** Unsupervised learning involves finding patterns in data that does not have labeled outcomes (i.e., no dependent variable). In this case, there is no target variable that explicitly indicates what you are trying to predict (like a label for a specific category or class). Instead, the goal is to discover natural groupings or patterns from the data itself. This type of analysis is useful for tasks like worker segmentation or clustering, where the goal is to group customers based on their similarities
